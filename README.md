## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod

# production mode with HTTPS
$ npm run start:prod:https
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## HTTPS Configuration

This application supports HTTPS in production environments. The HTTPS configuration is automatically enabled when `NODE_ENV=production`, or can be manually enabled by setting `USE_HTTPS=true`.

### Environment Variables

Configure HTTPS using the following environment variables:

- `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production` to automatically enable HTTPS
- `USE_HTTPS`: Set to `true` to manually enable HTTPS
- `SSL_CERT_PATH`: Path to your SSL certificate file (default: `/etc/ssl/certs/server.crt`)
- `SSL_KEY_PATH`: Path to your SSL private key file (default: `/etc/ssl/private/server.key`)
- `SSL_CA_PATH`: Path to your certificate chain file (optional, for intermediate certificates)
- `PORT`: Server port (default: `3000`)

### SSL Certificate Setup

1. **Obtain SSL certificates**: You can get certificates from:
   - Let's Encrypt (free)
   - Your domain provider
   - Self-signed certificates for development

2. **Place certificates**: Store your certificates in secure locations:

   ```bash
   # Example paths (adjust as needed)
   SSL_CERT_PATH=/etc/ssl/certs/your-domain.crt
   SSL_KEY_PATH=/etc/ssl/private/your-domain.key
   SSL_CA_PATH=/etc/ssl/certs/your-domain-chain.crt  # Optional: for intermediate certificates
   ```

3. **Set permissions**: Ensure proper file permissions:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/your-domain.crt
   sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/your-domain.key
   sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/your-domain-chain.crt  # If using certificate chain
   ```

4. **Certificate Chain**: The `SSL_CA_PATH` is optional but recommended for:
   - Intermediate certificates from your CA
   - Root certificates for better compatibility
   - Certificate bundles that include the full chain

### Running with HTTPS

```bash
# Production with HTTPS (automatic)
NODE_ENV=production npm run start:prod

# Manual HTTPS enablement
USE_HTTPS=true npm run start:prod

# Custom certificate paths with certificate chain
SSL_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cert.crt SSL_KEY_PATH=/path/to/key.key SSL_CA_PATH=/path/to/chain.crt npm run start:prod:https
```

### Development vs Production

- **Development**: Runs on HTTP by default for easier local development
- **Production**: Automatically attempts HTTPS, falls back to HTTP if certificates are missing

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
